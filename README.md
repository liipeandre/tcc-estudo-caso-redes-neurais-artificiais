Course completion work developed for the Computer Science course at Tuiuti University of Paraná.

## Author

- André Felipe Pereira dos Santos

## Description

This repository has:

- The developed algorithms.


## How to Run

- Install Python and dependencies: Scikit-Learn, Pickle and Numpy
- Unzip the dataset
- Run the 'generate_test_cases.py' file so that it generates a set of .txt files with the test cases in .json format.
- Run the file 'run_test_cases.py' passing as argument the directory of the .txt file to be processed, generated in the previous step.
- The output, containing the neural networks and the test results of each one of them, will be saved in the 'output' folder.
