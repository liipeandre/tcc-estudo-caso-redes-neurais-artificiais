Course completion work developed for the Computer Science course at Tuiuti University of Paraná.

## Author

- André Felipe Pereira dos Santos

## Description

This repository has:

- The developed algorithms.
- Runtime installation manuals.
- The obtained results.
- The written part, developed in LaTex, and the same in .pdf format.


## How to Run

- Install Python and dependencies: Scikit-Learn, Pickle and Numpy
- Unzip the dataset
- Run the 'generate_test_cases.py' file so that it generates a set of .txt files with the test cases in .json format.
- Run the file 'run_test_cases.py' passing as argument the directory of the file to be processed.
- The output, containing the neural networks and the results of each one of them, will be saved in the 'output' folder.
